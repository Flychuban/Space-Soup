              "[' Profile Sections tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News ‘I am not going anywhere’: Sen. Bob Menendez rejects calls to resign over bribery charges September 22, 2023, 4:39 PM New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy calls on Sen. Bob Menendez to resign over bribery charges September 22, 2023, 3:07 PM Biden tells Zelenskyy that the U.S. will send long-range missiles that Ukraine has repeatedly asked for, people familiar with the discussions say September 22, 2023, 11:49 AM Autoworkers strike will expand to more GM and Stellantis plants, and the head of the UAW extends an invitation for Biden to join the picket line September 22, 2023, 11:00 AM A capsule containing precious samples from an asteroid landed safely on Earth on Sunday, the culmination of a roughly 4-billion-mile journey over the past seven years. The asteroid samples were collected by NASA’s OSIRIS-REx spacecraft, which flew by Earth early Sunday morning and jettisoned the capsule over a designated landing zone in the Utah desert. The unofficial touchdown time was 8:52 a.m. MT, 3 minutes ahead of the predicted landing time.  The dramatic event —\\xa0which the NASA livestream narrator described as “opening a time capsule to our ancient solar system” —\\xa0marked a major milestone for the United States: The collected rocks and soil were NASA’s first samples brought back to Earth from an asteroid. Experts have said the bounty could help scientists unlock secrets about the solar system and how it came to be, including how life emerged on this planet. Bruce Betts, chief scientist at The Planetary Society, a nonprofit organization that conducts research, advocacy and outreach to promote space exploration, congratulated the NASA team on what he called an “impressive and very complicated mission,” adding that the asteroid samples are the start of a thrilling new chapter in space history. “It’s exciting because this mission launched in 2016 and so there’s a feeling of, ‘Wow, this day has finally come,’” he said. “But scientifically, it’s exciting because this is an amazing opportunity to study a very complex story that goes way back to the dawn of the solar system.” The samples were gathered from the surface of a near-Earth asteroid known as Bennu. The space rock, which is roughly as tall as the Empire State Building, is located more than 200 million miles away from Earth but orbits in such a way that it occasionally swings within 4.6 million miles of the planet. Bennu’s main draw owes to its age. The asteroid is estimated to have formed in the first 10 million years of the solar system’s existence, making it a pristine remnant from a chaotic time more than 4.5 billion years ago. As such, studying an asteroid’s chemical and physical properties is thought to be one of the best ways to understand the earliest days of the solar system. “They’re pretty well untouched from right around 4.5 billion years ago,” Betts said. “To get insights into these rocks gives real power to not just the science of asteroids but to everything in our solar system.” Researchers are keen to understand what role — if any — asteroids played in the emergence of life on Earth. There are theories, for instance, that asteroids and comets may have delivered water and other building blocks of life to the planet. Bennu has also been of interest to scientists because, like other near-Earth asteroids, it is classified as a potentially hazardous object. NASA’s Planetary Defense Coordination Office previously estimated that there is a 1 in 2,700 chance of Bennu slamming into Earth sometime between the years 2175 and 2199. It’s estimated that the sample return capsule contains around 8.8 ounces of rocky material from Bennu. After it is recovered, the capsule will be transported to a temporary clean room on the military range before being flown to NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston. Agency officials said they hope to open the capsule on Monday or Tuesday, though it may take around a week before scientists can accurately weigh how much rocky material is inside. The OSIRIS-REx spacecraft (short for Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, Security-Regolith Explorer) spent nearly two years circling Bennu before using its robotic arm in what was described as a “high five” maneuver to scoop up pieces of the space rock. Early Sunday, the spacecraft jettisoned the samples as it skirted 63,000 miles above Earth’s surface, sending the capsule screaming through the atmosphere at around 27,650 mph. A series of parachutes helped slow the capsule before it touched down in Utah’s western desert. While these are NASA’s first samples collected and brought back from an asteroid, they are not the first in history. Japan’s Hayabusa mission in 2010 delivered to Earth a few micrograms of material from an asteroid called Itokawa. A second mission, dubbed Hayabusa2, delivered to Earth a small sample from an asteroid known as Ryugu in December 2020.\\xa0 The $1 billion OSIRIS-REx spacecraft may have completed its high-profile delivery, but the probe is not yet finished with its journey. After releasing the sample capsule, the spacecraft fired its thrusters to take it beyond Earth and on a course to investigate another asteroid known as Apophis. This space rock, which measures about 1,200 feet across, is projected to come within 20,000 miles of Earth in 2029. As part of its extended mission, the OSIRIS-REx spacecraft will take careful measurements of the space rock’s orbit. NASA also intends to approach Apophis and use the spacecraft’s gas thrusters to dislodge and study rocky material from the asteroid.

A US Navy jet captured this video of an ‘unidentified aerial phenomenon’. The US Department of Defense released the video in 2020.Credit: US Navy NASA has waded into the contentious world of unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAPs), more commonly known as unidentified flying objects, or UFOs. On 14 September, the agency released a report by an independent study team that looks at how and why NASA might want to be involved in studying UAPs. There’s a long history of US government agencies assessing objects in the sky, stretching back to US military investigations into reports of flying saucers in the 1940s. But the report concludes that NASA is the agency best suited to lead scientifically driven and rigorous studies of UAPs. NASA has found no evidence to suggest that UAPs are extraterrestrial in origin. But it has appointed a director of UAP research, Mark McInerney, to oversee analysis of reports of mysterious flying things. Nature spoke to the chair of the independent panel, astrophysicist David Spergel at the Simons Foundation in New York City, about the part scientists might play in assessing UAP reports. It was a learning experience. I learned a lot about what data we collect in Earth science from NASA and from commercial satellites. Then I got a lot of e-mails from the public, which ranged from the curious to someone who writes regularly about the two aliens who live in her attic. The first step is to get a solid database of events. We have to work our way through all possible ways of understanding events. You first want to get images from multiple angles and show that it’s not something conventional like a balloon, drone or aeroplane. By its nature, this is going to be high-risk, high-reward. You’re most likely not going to discover something. But if you do, it’s very important. We have a problem in our society that people think there’s conspiracies and lots of things are hidden. And when the defence department has images of events, those images end up classified, not because of what’s in the image, but because of how the images were taken. To me, one of the most important recommendations in the report is that NASA develop an app for people’s cellphones that they can use to collect data. It’s an opportunity to engage the public in what science is about — when you see something you don’t understand, you collect data on it. And they can be part of that process. We do it in an open manner. The way to make progress is to collect more data, and NASA is good at collecting data. Think about cellphones as a unit of data collection. A phone measures magnetic field, gravitational field, local sound environment, local radio signal. What are the things you’d like to capture and encode? And how do we make sure that images aren’t tampered with? You want to make sure if you’re building a database that it is not contaminated with fraudulent images. It would be fun to play with. Most of the time when you see something odd, it’s going to be an aeroplane, it’s going to be a drone. NASA is funding work on technosignatures beyond the Solar System. An example of a nice project was looking through [telescope] data for Dyson spheres. Dyson spheres are [hypothetical structures] where you have some advanced civilization that builds a shell around its star, so you live inside the shell and convert all of the energy of a star into energy to run your civilization. Some clever astronomers realized if they were there, it would show up in existing data, and they went through and looked. The surface of the Moon, unlike Earth, doesn’t erode very quickly. We could look for signs of someone who landed on the Moon who wasn’t us. You could go through all the lunar imaging and look for weird landing sites. When someone says they’ve seen something strange, we don’t want to immediately say, I don’t believe it. Rather, say: OK, how do you test the strange idea? And let me give the mummies as an example. If this is real, send some samples to a number of labs and we’ll sequence what their DNA is. We have an obligation as scientists to sometimes spend a portion of our time checking reports of strange things. We need to not just approach things with the attitude of I believe or not, but collect data and see what we learn. It’s going to give us a teachable moment to show how science advances. doi: https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-023-02893-y This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

              " 'If NASA had asked astronaut Frank Rubio, well in advance, if he would like to spend a full year aboard the International Space Station, he likely would have turned it down. But that’s how it turned out anyway, when trouble with his crew’s Soyuz ferry ship forced them to extended a six-month stay to 12. “If they had asked me up front before training, because you do train for a year or two years for your mission, I probably would have declined,” Rubio told reporters Tuesday, eight days before he and his two Soyuz crewmates plan to return to Earth on Sept. 27. “It would have hurt, but I would have declined. “And that’s only because of family, things that were going on this past year,” he said of his wife and four children. “Had I known that I would have had to miss those very important events, I just would have had to say thank you, but no thank you.” But once training began for what was supposed to be a six-month flight he was committed, and he took the mission extension in stride “because ultimately that’s our job.” “We have to get the mission done,” he said. “Having the International Space Station (permanently occupied) for 23 years requires a lot of individual and family sacrifices. But sometimes that’s what you have to do.” That’s nothing new for Rubio, a West Point graduate, UH-60 Blackhawk combat helicopter pilot, flight surgeon and family physician. Among the family milestones he missed during his extended mission: a daughter finished her first year at the U.S. Naval Academy and a son began his freshman year at West Point. Rubio and his two Soyuz crewmates — Sergei Prokopyev and Dmitri Petelin — were launched to the space station last Sept. 21 aboard the Soyuz MS-22/68S ferry ship, kicking off a planned half-year stay, the standard duration for long-duration station crews. But their docked and dormant Soyuz was hit by a presumed micrometeoroid last December, rupturing a critical coolant line. After several weeks of analysis, Russian engineers decided the safest course of action was to launch a replacement spacecraft, forcing Prokopyev, Petelin and Rubio to extended their stay an additional six months. “When it finally became real that it was going to require me to stay for a full year (it) was difficult, although that decision really took a couple of months,” Rubio said. “And so essentially, we knew the situation, we were dealing with it, we were coming up with options. And so although it was difficult, honestly … my family and I had come to terms with it.” Rubio, Prokopyev and Petelin plan to strap into their replacement Soyuz MS-23/69S spacecraft and undock from the space station next Wednesday. If all goes well, they’ll land on the steppe of Kazakhstan around 7:14 a.m. EDT (5:14 p.m. local time) to close out a 371-day mission, the third longest flight in space history and the longest ever for a U.S. astronaut. After initial medical checks and phone calls home to family, Rubio will board a NASA jet for the flight back to Houston while Prokopyev and Petelin head for Star City near Moscow. Asked what he looked forward to the most once back on Earth, Rubio said “hugging my wife and kids is going to be paramount. And I’ll probably focus on that for the first couple days.” “We’re blessed enough to have kind of a quiet backyard,” he added. “And I think just going out in the yard and enjoying the trees and the silence. Up here, we kind of have the constant hum of machinery. … So I’m looking forward to just being outside and enjoying the peace and quiet.” As for re-adapting to gravity after a year in weightlessness, Rubio said it likely will take several months to get his land legs back and the normal sense of balance his vestibular system provides. But because this is his first spaceflight, and a yearlong stay at that, he’s not really sure what to expect. “When you go back to Earth … that constant force of gravity really affects a lot of us pretty strongly, and you may end up spending a lot of time being sick,” he said. “So your vestibular system is probably the most affected. “And then after that, it’s a couple of months to regain your strength. Our trainers do a great job of keeping us in shape up here. But the reality is we’re not standing, we’re not walking, we’re not bearing our own weight. And so it just takes some time to get your bones and your muscles used to doing that consistently back on Earth. It’ll be anywhere from two to six months before I essentially say that I feel normal.” \\n\\t\\t\\t© 1999-2023 Spaceflight Now Inc',\n",

              " 'Bill Nelson hails the Osiris-Rex mission’s success following its capsule’s landing in the Utah desert today Here is a look at where things currently stand: The sample capsule has arrived at the highly-secured clean room facility in Utah following its landing earlier this morning in the desert. This significant moment marks the successful delivery from the Utah desert into the clean room, and of course the 1.2 billion-mile journey from the asteroid Bennu back to Earth. Mission members also obtained samples from the surrounding area of the landing zone. Nasa TV showed scientists taking photos around the landing zone as well as measuring air and gas levels. Sir Brian May, of Queen, has told Nasa TV he is “immensely proud” to be a team member of Osiris-Rex. May was among those who helped to identify the location on Bennu where the samples would be collected. Nasa administrator Bill Nelson hailed the Osiris-Rex mission’s success following its capsule’s landing in the Utah desert today. “This mission proves that NASA does big things, things that have inspired us, things that unite us,” he said. By studying the samples from Bennu, scientists can compare their results against the data they obtained from instruments on board the spacecraft. This ‘ground-truthing’ means they can then calibrate the latter, allowing them to more accurately explore differences in composition across the surface of Bennu. We will be back at 5pm ET for Nasa’s press conference on this historic landing and will deliver the latest updates.

This significant moment marks the successful delivery from the Utah desert into the Utah test and training range clean room, and of course the 1.2 billion mile journey from the asteroid Bennu back to Earth. Team members carried the sample capsule onto a cart and have rolled the capsule into the portable clean room facility. Tomorrow morning, a C17 cargo plane is set to transport the sample to the Johnson Space Center in Houston. The sample capsule has arrived at the clean room facility following an approximately 20-minute helicopter ride.

In just a few moments, the sample capsule will be set for lift off. Nasa TV explains that the helicopter transportation process has been carefully rehearsed multiple times. Mission members are also obtaining samples from the surrounding area of the landing zone where the sample capsule landed earlier this morning in the Utah desert. Meanwhile, the sample capsule itself is being prepared to be attached to the long-line for helicopter operations – its final journey before it is opened up at the clean room and shipped to the Johnson Space Center in Houston. The sample capsule has been bagged by recovery mission members. It is set to be transported to the clean operation room next. Sir Brian May, of Queen, has told Nasa TV he is “immensely proud” to be a team member of Osiris-Rex. May was among those who helped to identify the location on Bennu where the samples would be collected. Together with others working on the mission, May – who has a PhD in astrophysics – has co-authored book about asteroid Bennu, including stereoscopic (3-D) images. “I can’t be with you today, I wish I could, I’m rehearsing for a Queen tour, but my heart is there with you as this precious sample is recovered,” he said. “Happy sample return day.” Nasa administrator Bill Nelson hailed the Osiris-Rex mission’s success following its capsule’s landing in the Utah desert today. “It brought something extraordinary – the largest asteroid sample ever received on Earth. It’s going to help scientists investigate planet formation, it’s going to improve our understanding of the asteroids that could possibly impact the earth and it will deepen our understanding of the origin of our solar system and its formation. This mission proves that NASA does big things, things that have inspired us, things that unite us… The mission continues with incredible science and analysis to come. But I want to thank you all, for everybody that made this Osiris-Rex mission possible… The impossible became possible,” said Nelson. Proffesor Neil Bowles of the University of Oxford, who is among the scientists who will be studying the samples, said he was relieved to see the sample return capsule on the ground. “Really excited for the next steps, getting the sample capsule safe in the clean room at Johnson Space Center and then seeing what is in side.

              " 'Advertisement Supported by The seven-year OSIRIS-REX mission ended on Sunday with the return of regolith from the asteroid Bennu, which might hold clues about the origins of our solar system and life. By Katrina Miller A brown-and-white capsule that spent the last seven years swooping through the solar system — and sojourning at an asteroid — has finally come home. And it has brought a cosmic souvenir: a cache of space rock that scientists are hungry to get their hands on. On Sunday morning, those scientists waited eagerly as the pod shot through Earth’s atmosphere at thousands of miles per hour. It gently parachuted down into the muddy landscape of the Utah Test and Training Range, about 80 miles west of Salt Lake City, at 8:52 a.m. local time. “This mission proves that NASA does big things,” said Bill Nelson, the administrator of the space agency. “Things that inspire us, things that unite us, things that show really nothing is beyond our reach.” The capsule’s landing is a major win for a NASA mission called OSIRIS-REX, which stands for Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resources Identification and Security-Regolith Explorer. The spacecraft set out in 2016 to retrieve material from Bennu, a carbon-rich asteroid about 190 feet wider than the height of the Empire State Building. Researchers hope this pristine space dirt will reveal clues about the birth of our solar system and the genesis of life on Earth. “This is a gift to the world,” said Dante Lauretta, a planetary scientist at the University of Arizona and the principal investigator of the OSIRIS-REX mission, at a news conference last month. Scientists who were working on the mission endured many twists and turns, including a seven-year struggle to get the project greenlit by NASA. Their perseverance paid off as OSIRIS-REX became the first American spacecraft to retrieve material from an asteroid, bringing back a staggering amount of matter from space for scientists around the world to study. But the victorious final act means so much more for the OSIRIS-REX team members, many of whom “grew up on this mission,” according to Dr. Lauretta. “A little bit of us is on that spacecraft,” said Rich Burns, the OSIRIS-REX program manager at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, at the news conference. “And a little bit of us is coming home with it.” Bennu, a near-Earth asteroid, is currently many millions of miles from our planet. Like other asteroids in the solar system, it is a geological relic of the protoplanetary disk — a swirling mix of gas and dust that eventually coalesced into planets — that surrounded our sun billions of years ago. One theory is that small worlds like Bennu once seeded Earth with the prebiotic ingredients needed to form life. But it is difficult to test this idea using meteorites, pieces of asteroids that reach Earth’s surface, which are heated by the atmosphere and are then contaminated by microbes on the ground, Dr. Lauretta said. Instead, many scientists turn their eyes (and their instruments) to space. This is not the first chunk of an asteroid brought back to Earth. In 2010, the Hayabusa mission, led by the Japanese space agency JAXA, managed, in spite of technical troubles, to recover less than a milligram of material from a near-Earth asteroid named Itokawa. A decade later, a follow-up mission, Hayabusa2, retrieved a few grams of space rock from Ryugu. With that sample, scientists have found evidence suggesting that asteroids had delivered water to the early Earth, and discovered the presence of uracil — a building block of RNA, a molecule that helps form proteins. OSIRIS-REX’s delivery will provide an abundant new stock of space rock. The team anticipates about half a pound of unsullied asteroid dirt. Shogo Tachibana, a planetary scientist at the University of Tokyo who led the Hayabusa2 sample analysis and is now a co-investigator on OSIRIS-REX, has “no idea” whether Bennu will be anything like Ryugu — but it’s what he is most looking forward to finding out. From the beginning, the mission was a marathon. American scientists had long dreamed of fetching dust from an asteroid, and in 2004, a group submitted an application for what would become OSIRIS-REX. But NASA returned the project with the lowest ranking: Category 4, or “thanks, but no thanks,” Dr. Lauretta said. “The first proposal just bombed.” The team tried again in 2007. This time, it scored a ranking of Category 1 — but failed to snag funding because the budget was too large. The third time was the charm. NASA selected the project in 2011. “So that began our real journey,” said Harold Connolly, a cosmochemist at Rowan University who joined OSIRIS-REX 15 years ago. The team spent another half-decade “making sure all our little ducks were in a row,” he said, including designing and building the spacecraft, mapping the trek to Bennu and plotting the science campaign. OSIRIS-REX launched in 2016, embarking on a roundabout series of fuel-efficient loops before arriving at Bennu on Dec. 3, 2018. Despite the meticulous planning, the mission repeatedly faced the unexpected. “I call Bennu the trickster,” Dr. Lauretta said endearingly. “Because it has challenged us constantly on this program.” Mission specialists expected Bennu’s surface to consist of smooth, sandy seas of fine particles. But as the asteroid came into focus, they found it was rocky and rough, with boulders, some 10 stories tall, sprinkled throughout. That made finding a place where the spacecraft could safely retrieve a sample from the surface riskier. Engineers were troubleshooting that problem when Bennu threw them another loop: It was spewing rubble into space. That was “really exciting scientifically,” said Sandy Freund, the OSIRIS-REX program manager at the aerospace company Lockheed Martin. But “from an engineering standpoint,” the discovery posed a new problem. The mission scientists frantically churned out calculations to make sure OSIRIS-REX was safe from being struck by the asteroid’s gravelly plumes. The operations team swiftly wrote new navigation software that could compensate for the rugged terrain on Bennu. The next big hurdle was to select a sample site: a place where the spacecraft could safely fill its canister with fine grain regolith. That was made more difficult by the uneven ground of Bennu. Photos of the asteroid revealed some sandy regions on the surface — but only inside bowl-shaped craters. “We got to get inside one of those,” Dr. Lauretta said, to the distress of the operations team. “There’s nowhere else to go.” The margin for error was small. Touch down wrong, and the spacecraft may have faced a fate like Hayabusa, which crash-landed on its asteroid. Or worse: OSIRIS-REX comes down on a slope and runs into what Dr. Lauretta calls “the banana peel scenario,” where it slips and falls into a crater. “And then it’s all over,” he said. After two years of surveying the asteroid, the mission team chose a spot it named Nightingale, near the asteroid’s north pole. In October 2020, OSIRIS-REX punched the surface of Bennu using a tool that was supposed to bounce off Bennu like a pogo stick. But it did not exactly bounce as planned. Dr. Connolly recalled that he was shocked at how deep the instrument penetrated into the asteroid — about one and a half feet. “We thought it would be a little more firm,” he said. “But it turns out gravity is basically the only thing that’s holding it together.” The blow excavated a 30-foot-wide crater and blasted dusty debris into space — an unintentional experiment that revealed some properties of Bennu’s subsurface. The surprises didn’t end there. When the team checked to make sure it had collected a large enough sample, it found the chamber overflowing with regolith. “We had overachieved,” Ms. Freund said. “It was wedged open and leaking into space.” Every movement of the spacecraft led to greater loss of Bennu’s dust, like the way salt comes out of a shaker. The team immediately halted all planned maneuvers to prevent losing any more of its precious cargo. Instead, the crew rushed to stow what remained in the leaky chamber within the return capsule. Six months later, OSIRIS-REX captured one last look at Nightingale and then began the two-year journey back to Earth. “It was definitely an adventure,” Dr. Lauretta said. In the days leading up to the sample’s plunge into Earth’s atmosphere, Dr. Lauretta was having trouble sleeping. He tried to push away “all of the doom scenarios” like what happened with NASA’s Genesis, a probe that grabbed plasma from the solar wind to bring back to Earth. In 2004, it crashed into a Utah desert when the parachute for its return capsule failed to deploy. (Despite the rough landing, researchers were able to recover and analyze the sample.) “And that felt like a gut punch then,” Dr. Lauretta said while squeezing a stress ball shaped like the OSIRIS-REX capsule. Approaching the latest sample return was “unlike anything I’ve ever felt before,” he added. “I feel like there’s an electric wire at the base of my spine, just tingling.” Michael Puzio, an engineering major at North Carolina State University, also felt “a bit terrified” leading up to the sample’s return. In third grade, Mr. Puzio won a contest to name the asteroid Bennu. It ignited in him a love of space and a dream to be an astronaut. “But I think it’s in good hands,” Mr. Puzio added. The mission team “is pretty good at math, so I’ve heard.” At 2 a.m. local time on Sunday morning, the OSIRIS-REX command team in Littleton, Colo., evaluated the landing conditions and held a go-or-no-go poll on the capsule drop. The team voted go and OSIRIS-REX released the capsule at 4:42 a.m. Four hours later, it entered Earth’s atmosphere. A high-altitude camera on a NASA plane captured the fireball streaking across the lavender sky as the capsule’s heat shield protected the cargo from temperatures of more than 5,000 degrees Fahrenheit. The first parachute inflated 19 miles above the surface. The main chute deployed at a higher altitude than planned, which led to a landing three minutes earlier than expected. The capsule, charred from its journey through the atmosphere, landed on its nose. About half an hour after the landing, a mission team reached the capsule and began the procedures to recover it. For Dr. Lauretta, the safe return is both a professional achievement and a personal one: Michael Drake, the former principal investigator of OSIRIS-REX, died only five months after the mission was funded. “You need to be the one that finishes the dream,” Dr. Lauretta said Dr. Drake told him. “And so I did.” The capsule and its contents were stowed in a temporary clean room near the Utah landing site and then will be transferred to NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston. Scientists plan to crack open the canister on Tuesday, and get a small amount of the material into the lab for what Dr. Connolly calls a “quick look” analysis. In October, the sample team will reveal the first results to the world, including Bennu’s composition and how it compares with material brought back from the asteroids studied by the Japanese missions. Dr. Connolly struggled to express what it meant to him that the mission had come back to Earth. “I feel like a little kid again,” he said. “I’m just so happy to be able to tell the story that these rocks contain.” Scientists will spend the next two years conducting a more robust investigation of the asteroid. Small portions of the sample will be handed off to JAXA and the Canadian Space Agency for their own analyses. Up to 75 percent of Bennu’s regolith will remain in storage so that scientists in the future can “work on the sample with new techniques that we don’t even know exist yet,” Dr. Connolly said. The OSIRIS-REX mission may have come to an end, but the spacecraft remains fully operational in space. It will next visit Apophis, another near-Earth asteroid that was once seen as a major threat to crash into Earth. More recent measurements determined that the asteroid will pass by Earth in 2029, within one-tenth of the distance to the moon. The new project is named OSIRIS-APEX, where APEX means Apophis Explorer, and may provide information for mitigating more hazardous encounters with asteroids. The leader of OSIRIS-APEX will be Dani Mendoza DellaGiustina, a former student of Dr. Lauretta’s who is now a planetary scientist at the University of Arizona. It is another example of how the journey to Bennu and back has, from the project’s conception, raised a generation of scientists in the field. “I’ve been working on some incarnation of this mission basically my entire adult life,” Dr. DellaGiustina said. She added that while she was “super stoked” about OSIRIS-REX’s return, “for me, it’s definitely not the last hurrah.” Katrina Miller is a science reporting fellow for The Times.

              " 'Watch CBS News \\n            By William Harwood\\n           \\nUpdated on:  September 24, 2023 / 1:21 PM\\n          / CBS News\\n         A saucer-shaped capsule carrying asteroid fragments that may hold clues about the birth of the solar system slammed into Earth\\'s atmosphere Sunday and descended to an on-target parachute-assisted touchdown in Utah to wrap up a dramatic seven-year, four-billion-mile voyage. Released from the OSIRIS-REx mothership four hours earlier, the 110-pound 31-inch-wide sample return capsule, loaded with a half-pound of rocks and soil collected in 2020 from an asteroid known as Bennu, hit the top of the discernible atmosphere, 82 miles up, at a blistering 27,700 mph at 10:42 a.m. EDT. Over the next two minutes, rapidly decelerating in a hellish blaze of atmospheric friction, the capsule\\'s heat shield endured reentry temperatures of more than 5,000 degrees and a braking force 32 times the force of gravity as it streaked toward landing at the Utah Test and Training Range west of Salt Lake City. With scientists and engineers holding their collective breath — a similar capsule crash landed in Utah in 2004 when its parachutes failed to open — the OSIRIS-REx sample return capsule survived its trial by fire and presumably deployed a stabilizing drogue parachute at an altitude of 20 miles. The 24-foot-wide main capsule was expected to unfurl and inflate at an altitude of 5,000 feet, but NASA said it actually deployed at 20,000 feet. That may have contributed to a slightly earlier-than-expected touchdown, but in any case, the main chute appeared to lower the sample return capsule to an expected 11-mph landing at 10:52 a.m. EDT, the final step in a nail-biting descent. Recovery crews from prime contractor Lockheed Martin and the Utah Test and Training Range were on the scene within minutes to document the condition of the capsule, looking for any signs of a breach that could cause contamination of the pristine samples inside. Also on hand: University of Arizona Principal Investigator Dante Lauretta, part of a team assigned to characterize the surrounding environment to thoroughly document the chemical makeup of the landing zone. Just in case. But there were no apparent problems, the capsule was intact and there were no signs of any breaches that could have let earthly contaminants inside. Once that was confirmed, a helicopter carried the capsule to a temporary air-filtered \"clean room\" to begin  disassembly and to make preparations to ship the samples to a more sophisticated laboratory at the Johnson Space  Center in Houston on Monday. Lauretta said the samples — the  largest collection of extraterrestrial material since the Apollo moon  program — are representative of the raw material that formed the sun  and its retinue of planets 4.5 billion years ago. \"We\\'re going  back to the dawn of the solar system, we\\'re looking for clues as to why  Earth is a habitable world, this rare jewel in outer space that has  oceans, it has a protective atmosphere,\" he said. \"We think all of those  materials were brought (to Earth) by these carbon-rich asteroids very  early in our planetary system formation. \"And of course, the biggest question, the one that drives my scientific investigations, is the origin of life. What is life? How did it originate? And why was the Earth the place that it occurred? ... We believe that we\\'re bringing back that kind of material, maybe representatives of the seeds of life that these asteroids delivered at the beginning of (Earth\\'s history).\" Two Japanese spacecraft returned small samples from asteroids in 2010 and 2020, but OSIRIS-REx — a convoluted acronym that stands for Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification and Security Regolith Explorer — is the first such mission mounted by NASA. After initial analysis in Houston, NASA will share samples of Bennu with researchers around the world. \"This is a gift to the world,\" Lauretta said. \"We have laboratories on four continents, 16 timezones, hundreds of researchers, over 60 laboratories that have been getting ready to get this material, and we are ready to begin the final science campaign of the OSIRIS-REx prime mission.\" Equipped with three cameras, two spectrometers, a laser altimeter and an X-ray imaging system developed by college students, the OSIRIS-REx spacecraft and sample return capsule were launched atop a United Launch Alliance Atlas 5 rocket from Cape Canaveral on Sept. 8, 2016. To reach Bennu, which orbits in a plane tilted six degrees from Earth\\'s, OSIRIS-REx looped around the sun and then made a velocity-boosting gravity-assist flyby of Earth on Sept. 22, 2017. The spacecraft finally slipped into orbit around Bennu in late 2018. Scientists were stunned at what they found. Instead of a more typical body, with fine-grained soils and rocks atop a more or less solid interior, Bennu, about as wide as the Empire State Building is tall, turned out to be a loosely compacted rubble pile that behaved more like a fluid than a solid. After extensive mapping to identify a safe sample-collection point, OSIRIS-REx slowly descended toward the surface on Oct. 20, 2020, its pie pan-shaped \"Touch-And-Go Sample Acquisition Mechanism,\" or TAGSAM, poised at the end of an 11-foot-long robot arm. On contact, the probe fired a jet of nitrogen gas around the interior of the 12-inch-wide TAGSAM, stirring up the soil and small rocks underneath and blowing some of the material into collection filters before the spacecraft reversed course and backed away. \"It behaved very much like a fluid, there was no resistance to the downward motion of the spacecraft,\" Lauretta said in an interview. \"We sank in about 50 centimeters (20 inches) and if we hadn\\'t fired the back-away thrusters, I think we would have just gone right into the asteroid and disappeared.\" After backing away from Bennu, the TAGSAM mechanism and its precious samples were stowed inside the OSIRIS-REx return capsule for the long flight back to Earth and Sunday\\'s dramatic reentry. After course corrections to line up on the Utah landing site, the OSIRIS-REx mothership released the sample return capsule at 6:42 a.m. EDT. With the capsule safely on its way, the OSIRIS-REx spacecraft fired its thrusters 20 minutes later, ensuring it would safely miss Earth by about 484 miles. The \"divert\" maneuver put the craft on course for a close encounter with the asteroid Apophis in 2029. Roughly 1,200 feet across, Apophis will come within a scant 20,000 miles of Earth in 2029, a very near miss in astronomical terms. The OSIRIS-REx spacecraft, now known as the OSIRIS-Apophis Explorer, will brake into orbit around Apophis shortly after the asteroid\\'s Earth flyby, kicking off extended observations.

              " 'Since ChatGPT’s release in late 2022, many news outlets have reported on the ethical threats posed by artificial intelligence. Tech pundits have issued warnings of killer robots bent on human extinction, while the World Economic Forum predicted that machines will take away jobs. The tech sector is slashing its workforce even as it invests in AI-enhanced productivity tools. Writers and actors in Hollywood are on strike to protect their jobs and their likenesses. And scholars continue to show how these systems heighten existing biases or create meaningless jobs – amid myriad other problems. There is a better way to bring artificial intelligence into workplaces. I know, because I’ve seen it, as a sociologist who works with NASA’s robotic spacecraft teams. The scientists and engineers I study are busy exploring the surface of Mars with the help of AI-equipped rovers. But their job is no science fiction fantasy. It’s an example of the power of weaving machine and human intelligence together, in service of a common goal. Instead of replacing humans, these robots partner with us to extend and complement human qualities. Along the way, they avoid common ethical pitfalls and chart a humane path for working with AI. Stories of killer robots and job losses illustrate how a “replacement myth” dominates the way people think about AI. In this view, humans can and will be replaced by automated machines. Amid the existential threat is the promise of business boons like greater efficiency, improved profit margins and more leisure time. Empirical evidence shows that automation does not cut costs. Instead, it increases inequality by cutting out low-status workers and increasing the salary cost for high-status workers who remain. Meanwhile, today’s productivity tools inspire employees to work more for their employers, not less. Alternatives to straight-out replacement are “mixed autonomy” systems, where people and robots work together. For example, self-driving cars must be programmed to operate in traffic alongside human drivers. Autonomy is “mixed” because both humans and robots operate in the same system, and their actions influence each other. However, mixed autonomy is often seen as a step along the way to replacement. And it can lead to systems where humans merely feed, curate or teach AI tools. This saddles humans with “ghost work” – mindless, piecemeal tasks that programmers hope machine learning will soon render obsolete. Replacement raises red flags for AI ethics. Work like tagging content to train AI or scrubbing Facebook posts typically features traumatic tasks and a poorly paid workforce spread across the Global South. And legions of autonomous vehicle designers are obsessed with “the trolley problem” – determining when or whether it is ethical to run over pedestrians. But my research with robotic spacecraft teams at NASA shows that when companies reject the replacement myth and opt for building human-robot teams instead, many of the ethical issues with AI vanish. Strong human-robot teams work best when they extend and augment human capabilities instead of replacing them. Engineers craft machines that can do work that humans cannot. Then, they weave machine and human labor together intelligently, working toward a shared goal. Often, this teamwork means sending robots to do jobs that are physically dangerous for humans. Minesweeping, search-and-rescue, spacewalks and deep-sea robots are all real-world examples. Teamwork also means leveraging the combined strengths of both robotic and human senses or intelligences. After all, there are many capabilities that robots have that humans do not – and vice versa. For instance, human eyes on Mars can only see dimly lit, dusty red terrain stretching to the horizon. So engineers outfit Mars rovers with camera filters to “see” wavelengths of light that humans can’t see in the infrared, returning pictures in brilliant false colors. Meanwhile, the rovers’ onboard AI cannot generate scientific findings. It is only by combining colorful sensor results with expert discussion that scientists can use these robotic eyes to uncover new truths about Mars. Another ethical challenge to AI is how data is harvested and used. Generative AI is trained on artists’ and writers’ work without their consent, commercial datasets are rife with bias, and ChatGPT “hallucinates” answers to questions. The real-world consequences of this data use in AI range from lawsuits to racial profiling. Robots on Mars also rely on data, processing power and machine learning techniques to do their jobs. But the data they need is visual and distance information to generate driveable pathways or suggest cool new images. By focusing on the world around them instead of our social worlds, these robotic systems avoid the questions around surveillance, bias and exploitation that plague today’s AI. Robots can unite the groups that work with them by eliciting human emotions when integrated seamlessly. For example, seasoned soldiers mourn broken drones on the battlefield, and families give names and personalities to their Roombas. I saw NASA engineers break down in anxious tears when the rovers Spirit and Opportunity were threatened by Martian dust storms. Unlike anthropomorphism – projecting human characteristics onto a machine – this feeling is born from a sense of care for the machine. It is developed through daily interactions, mutual accomplishments and shared responsibility. When machines inspire a sense of care, they can underline – not undermine – the qualities that make people human. In industries where AI could be used to replace workers, technology experts might consider how clever human-machine partnerships could enhance human capabilities instead of detracting from them. Script-writing teams may appreciate an artificial agent that can look up dialog or cross-reference on the fly. Artists could write or curate their own algorithms to fuel creativity and retain credit for their work. Bots to support software teams might improve meeting communication and find errors that emerge from compiling code. Of course, rejecting replacement does not eliminate all ethical concerns with AI. But many problems associated with human livelihood, agency and bias shift when replacement is no longer the goal. The replacement fantasy is just one of many possible futures for AI and society. After all, no one would watch “Star Wars” if the ‘droids replaced all the protagonists. For a more ethical vision of humans’ future with AI, you can look to the human-machine teams that are already alive and well, in space and on Earth.
